My first paper as a lead author, [Solving Inverse Problems with Score-Based Generative Priors learned from Noisy Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01166), got accepted at [IEEE Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers, 2023] (https://www.asilomarsscconf.org/) for a poster presentation.
