## Bikepacking across Mexico

<img src="/images/adventure/bikepacking_rig.jpg" alt="bikepacking set-up">

In 2020 I finished my first ever bike build using a <a href="https://shop.fairdalebikes.com/products/rockitship-gravel-frame-and-enve-fork-kit">Fairdale Rockitship</a>. 
Its first proper expedition was the <a href="https://bikepacking.com/routes/trans-mexico-norte/">Trans Mexico Bikepacking Route</a>, a 1500-mile route which traverses mostly rural, mountainous regions on back roads. 
I had to prepare for a variety of conditions, as temperatures ranged from 30-90&#176;F and elevation from sea level to 14,000 feet. 
This solo journey from Mazatlan to Oaxaca became much more about cycling, though, as the most fulfilling aspect was spending time with locals in small villages along the way. 
Altogether it made for a jubilant intersection of nature and culture.
