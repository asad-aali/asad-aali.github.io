## Coffee Table

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/one_year_on_a_bike.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [One Year on a Bike]() by xxx | A journey from --- to --- with captivating photographs and journal entries. Amidst the usual day-to-day grind, books like this remind me of the profound possibility and the sense of serendipity in cross continental cycling trips. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/nature_photography.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Creative Nature and Outdoor Photography]() by xxx | Stunning landscape imagery accompanied by fundamental photography techniques. This book provided easy access to expand my creative vision and motivate using my camera more often. |


&nbsp;
## Ecology 

| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | 
| &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| <img style="float: left;" path="assets/img/2205_books/braiding_sweetgrass.png" width="100" height="100"> | [Braiding Sweetgrass]() by Robin Wall Kimmerer | Interweaving scientific and indigenous knowledge of nature with the goal of awakening a wider ecological consciousness. For me it served as a reminder of our reciprocal relationship with the world––and a call to cultivate ways I can give in return. |


&nbsp;
## Fiction

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/dune.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Dune]() by Frank Herbert | An engrossing story of betrayal, conquest, and destiny. The imaginative intricacies of this book propelled my entry into fantasy novels. xxx's recent derivative film is also fantastic! |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/siddartha.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Siddhartha]() by Herman Hesse | Journey of a wealthy Indian Brahmin who leaves a life of privilege to seek fulfillment. I was really intrigued by its synthesis of Eastern religion and Western individualism into a life containing very distinct chapters. |


&nbsp;
## Health and Fitness

| <img style="float: left;" path="assets/img/2205_books/supple_leopard.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Becoming a Supple Leopard]() by Kelly Starrett | Mobility frameworks and exercises for an active lifestyle. The lessons I learned here were crucial for mitigating injury in ultra-distance cycling, while the fundamental intuition of biomechanics were immensely valuable. |


&nbsp;
## Historical Biographies

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/promised_land.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [A Promised Land]() by Barack Obama | Intimate view into Obama's internal tension between his idealistic dreams for a better world and the practical limitations of political office. I really admired his compassionate poise while making high-stakes moral decisions. | 
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/team_of_rivals.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Team of Rivals]() by Doris Kearns Goodwin | Gripping account of Lincoln's character and empathy leading a contentious group of his talented political rivals through a terribly turbulent time. I found his extraordinary emotional intelligence and leadership skills profoundly inspiring. |


&nbsp;
## Memoirs

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/mans_search_for_meaning.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Man's Search for Meaning]() by Victor Frankl | Riveting memoir of Nazi death camps and the ensuing lessons learned during Frankl's career as a psychiatrist. It was a remarkable demonstration of the human ability to choose how we experience life and define purpose, even amidst grueling circumstances. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/when_breath.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [When Breath Becomes Air]() by Paul Kalanithi | Reflection on what makes life worth living from the unique perspective of a neurosurgeon---who himself has advised hundreds of patients facing death---as he grapples with his own terminal diagnosis at the age of 36. I admired Kalanithi's eloquent grasp of deeper meaning without getting caught up in an incredibly competitive career landscape. | 


&nbsp;
## Poetry

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/the_prohet.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [The Prophet]() by Kahlil Gibran | A collection of potent poetic essays exploring fundamental human concepts such as work, marriage, and self-knowledge. Each poem is so short, it's easy to pop this book open for a contemplative nugget. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/rumi.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [The Essential Rumi]() by Rumi | Lyrical translations of the 13th-century Sufi Mystic. Rumi's abstract metaphors originate from an entirely different time and culture. Sometimes I sift through to find profound insight; sometimes I humbly miss the point––or come to accept that perhaps there isn't one. |


&nbsp;
## Self-help

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/how_to_win_friends.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [How to Win Friends and Influence People]() by Dale Carnegie | Fundamental, concise, and timeless advice for communication. This has helped me better co-exist and collaborate with people both professionally and personally. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/make_it_stick.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Make it Stick]() by Peter Brown et al. | Principles of comprehension and memory supported by rigorous research plus tangible techniques for better learning. This completely conflicted my original intuition for how we humans learn. A must for any student or educator. |


&nbsp;
## Social Psychology and Society 

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/righteous_mind.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [The Righteous Mind]() by Jonathan Haidt | Research examining moral intuition and its impact on the sociopolitical landscape---particularly relevant given today's personal information streams. Personally reading this enabled deeper understanding and empathy for people whose views (at first glance) seem so mind bogglingly different from my own. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/think_again.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Think Again]() by Adam Grant | The critical art of re-thinking one's engrained ideas and how that enhances progress both internally and with others. For me it emphasized how encumbered I'll be from shaping the world unless I remain curious about it. | 
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/sapiens.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Sapiens]() by Yuval Noah Harari | Wide-ranging account covering the entire timeline of our species and the formation of human societies. The perspetive in this book felt encouraging, as I'm generally very concerned about our current civilization's transition into the digital age. |


&nbsp;
## Spirituality

| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/power_of_now.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [The Power of Now]() by Eckhart Tolle | Thorough, tangible depiction of being present and how that enables a fulfilling life. This is often the first book I recommend for those interested in mindfulness, as I found it very helpful how Tolle re-iterates the same points from different angles. |
| <img style="float: left;" src="assets/img/2205_books/be_here_now.jpg" width="100" height="100"> | [Be Here Now]() by Ram Dass | Illustrative depictions of conscious experience to help shepherd a sense of the sacred into everyday existence. I really like how saliently Ram Dass reconciles the underlying spiritual connection between different religions. |
