## bio
I am graduating with a Master's in <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</a> from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, advised by Dr. <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a>.

During my MS in ECE, I completed a research internship at <a href="https://health.amazon.com/">Amazon Health</a>, exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) in clinical text summarization tasks. Previously, I graduated with a Master of Science in Information Technology (<a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/graduate/specialized-masters/ms-it-and-management/">MSITM</a>) from The University of Texas at Austin and completed my capstone project at <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us">Dell Technologies</a>, as a Machine Learning Engineer.
