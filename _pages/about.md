I'm passionate about exploring new ways we can use data to solve important problems in areas such as medicine, education, and socioeconomic disparity. 
Ultimately my goal is to steer emerging technology's societal impact in a more positive direction.

[//]: # My goal is to equip myself with the skills to steer emerging technology's societal impact in a more positive direction.

Currently I am pursuing a PhD in Stanford's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept advised by <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~pauly/">John Pauly</a>, <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>, and <a href="https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/">Gordon Wetzstein</a>. 
My research is focused on developing machine learning (ML) algorithms for computational imaging problems, from computer vision applications to physics-based modalities such as MRI and cryo-EM. I'm also excited about harnessing large language models to improve healthcare.

## bio
Prior to beginning his PhD, Dave spent two years as a research scientist at a Bay Area <a href="https://subtlemedical.com/">start-up</a> and the <a href="">Artifical Intelligence in Medicine & Imaging (AIMI)</a> center at Stanford.
Previously he earned a M.S. in EE at the University of Texas conducting ML research under <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>
and <a href="http://sriram.utlinc.org/#/">Sriram Vishwanath</a>, during which he also served as a <a href="https://www.datascienceforsocialgood.org/">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow in London. 
Before that Dave earned a B.S. in EE at the University of Wisconsin, where he created and led a 150-person <a href="https://badgerloop.org/about-past.html">organization</a> to build a hyperloop pod for SpaceX.
