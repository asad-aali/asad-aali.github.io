I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ibiis.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>. My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for healthcare applications.

I will be joining Apple as a Machine Learning intern in Summer 2026.

Before joining Stanford, I completed a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at the <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas at Austin</a>, where I was mentored by <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a> and <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>.
