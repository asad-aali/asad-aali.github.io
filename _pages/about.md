I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ibiis.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>, advised by <a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/akshay-chaudhari">Akshay Chaudhari</a>. My research focuses on developing machine learning methods for healthcare applications.

Before joining Stanford, I completed a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, where I was mentored by <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a> and <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>. I also completed a research internship at <a href="https://health.amazon.com/">Amazon</a>, studying the landscape of adapted large language models (LLMs) in clinical text summarization tasks.
