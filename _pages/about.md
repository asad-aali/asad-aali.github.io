I am a research scientist at <a href="https://ibiis.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a>. My research focuses on developing reliable, efficient, and scalable _computer systems for AI applications_.

I will be joining <a href="https://machinelearning.apple.com/">Apple</a> as a Machine Learning intern in Summer 2026.

Before joining Stanford, I completed a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">UT Austin</a>.
