I'm passionate about exploring new ways that data can be used to solve important problems in areas such as medicine, education, and socioeconomic disparity. My goal is to equip myself with the skills to steer technology's societal impact in a more positive direction.

To that end I am pursuing a PhD in Stanford University's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept. My research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms for computational imaging problems such as compressed sensing and MRI reconstruction. Ultimately I view the PhD as training to cultivate my capacity to conceive, evaluate, and develop new ideas so I can become a leader in technological innovation.
