## Professional Purpose
I'm passionate about exploring new ways that data can be used to solve important problems in areas such as medicine, education, and socioeconomic disparity. 
My goal is to equip myself with the skills to steer technology's societal impact in a more positive direction.

To that end I am pursuing a PhD in Stanford University's Electrical Engineering (EE) Dept. 
My research is focused on developing machine learning algorithms for computational imaging problems such as compressed sensing and MRI reconstruction. 
Ultimately I view the PhD as training to cultivate my capacity to conceive, evaluate, and develop new ideas at the boundary of intellectual rigor and creativity.

## Bio
Dave spent two years at a Bay Area <a href="https://subtlemedical.com/">start-up</a> developing new algorithms for commercial deployment. 
Previously he earned an M.S. in EE from the University of Texas doing machine learning research under the supervision of <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>
and <a href="http://sriram.utlinc.org/#/">Sriram Vishwanath</a>
, during which time he also served as a <a href="https://www.dssgfellowship.org/">Data Science for Social Good</a> fellow.
