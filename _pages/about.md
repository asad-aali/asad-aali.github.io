## bio
I will be interning at Adobe in the Summer of 2024 as a Machine Learning Researcher.

Currently, I am a second-year PhD student at the <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</a> department at <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, advised by Prof <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a>.

During the first year of my PhD, I completed a research internship at <a href="https://www.onemedical.com/">One Medical</a>, a division of <a href="https://health.amazon.com/">Amazon Health</a>.

Previously, I earned an MS in Information Technology at the University of Texas at Austin and completed my capstone project at <a href="https://www.dell.com/en-us">Dell Technologies</a>, as a Machine Learning Engineer.
