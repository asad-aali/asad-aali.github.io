Prior to joining Stanford, I graduated with a Master's in <a href="https://www.ece.utexas.edu/">Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)</a> from <a href="https://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>, advised by Dr. <a href="https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~jtamir/">Jon Tamir</a>. During my MS in ECE, I completed a research internship at <a href="https://health.amazon.com/">Amazon Health</a>, exploring the application of large language models (LLMs) in clinical text summarization tasks.
